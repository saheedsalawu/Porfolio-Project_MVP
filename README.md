……Move in the most professional way….
Drivry is a web application that is designed to help link a professional driver to car owners. Drivry is specifically designed to help solve the problem of getting a professional driver for both short distance and long distance journeys. Drivry is also intended to help tackle the issue of unemployment as well help prevent excessive spending of hiring permanent drivers. 
With Drivry professional registered drivers will be able to register and indicate their availability at specific times. Drivers will also be able to get rated based on their performance, punctuality, safety concern and timeliness. Also, users who need the service of a driver will be able to register, request a driver at specific times and chat with available drivers of their stuff. Users will be able to search my location, their type of car and rating.
