……Move in the most professional way….
Drivry is a web application that is designed to help link a professional driver to car owners. Drivry is specifically designed to help solve the problem of getting a professional driver for both short distance and long distance journeys. Drivry is also intended to help tackle the issue of unemployment as well help prevent excessive spending of hiring permanent drivers. 
With Drivry professional registered drivers will be able to register and indicate their availability at specific times. Drivers will also be able to get rated based on their performance, punctuality, safety concern and timeliness. Also, users who need the service of a driver will be able to register, request a driver at specific times and chat with available drivers of their stuff. Users will be able to search my location, their type of car and rating.

# MVP SUMMARY
We will be adopting the single page web application architecture. This offers our web application a dynamic frame-work, which allows for interaction with users by use of data update within the existing page. This means application requests only needed content details and loading totally new pages from the server will be prevented and the process will help managing UI view creation that is detached from the server, which is an advantage from architectural standpoint.
